# Career Path Backend

FastAPI-based backend service for Career Navigator, providing intelligent career path recommendations through graph-based relationship mapping and AI-powered ranking.

## Status
Production Ready | Version 1.0.0 | January 15, 2026

## Overview

The backend serves as the core intelligence engine for the Career Navigator application, managing:
- **Career Data**: 1000+ educational pathways across 10+ career domains
- **Path Resolution**: Graph-based computation of valid course-to-career transitions
- **Intelligent Ranking**: AI-powered career recommendations based on user interests and academic performance
- **Academic Rules**: Deterministic filtering based on subject combinations and eligibility criteria

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.9+
- **Package Manager**: `pip`
- **Database**: JSON-based (in-memory on startup)
- **RAM**: 256MB minimum
- **Disk**: 20MB for data files

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the Server
```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### 3. Verify Installation

## Project Structure

```

├── main.py              # FastAPI application & all endpoints
├── data_loader.py       # JSON data loading & in-memory indexing
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, python-multipart)

```

## Core Architecture

### Data Loading (data_loader.py)
- **DataLoader class**: Loads all career, course, exam, and stream JSON files from `../career-data/`
- **Indexing**: Creates in-memory indices for O(1) node lookups (by ID)
- **Graph Building**: Constructs node-edge relationships from `graph_edges.json`
- **Rule Application**: Applies transition rules from `transition_rules.json`
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single DataLoader instance reused across all requests

### API Server (main.py)
- **Framework**: FastAPI (async Python framework)
- **CORS**: Enabled for frontend requests from `http://localhost:5173`
- **Error Handling**: Consistent 404/400/500 error responses with detailed messages
- **Async Processing**: All endpoints are async for non-blocking I/O

## Data Model

### Core Data Files
The system loads JSON definitions from `../career-data/`:

#### Node Types
- **Streams** (`streams.json`): Science, Commerce, Arts, Vocational
- **Stream Variants** (`stream_variants.json`): MPC, BiPC, HEC, HPS, etc.
- **Courses** (`courses.json`): Degree programs, diplomas, certifications
- **Careers** (`careers.json`): Job profiles with roadmaps and skill requirements
- **Exams** (`exams/` folder): JEE, NEET, UPSC, CA, CMA, etc.
- **Education Levels** (`education_levels/`): Class 10, Class 12, Bachelor, etc.

#### Relationship Files
- **Graph Edges** (`mappings/graph_edges.json`): Defines valid transitions between nodes
- **Transition Rules** (`rules/transition_rules.json`): Blocks invalid subject→course combinations

### Node ID Format
All nodes use namespaced IDs for clarity:
```
stream:science           # Stream
stream_variant:mpc      # Stream variant
course:jee_main         # Exam/course
career:software_engineer # Career profile
education_level:class_12 # Education level
```

      "score": 92,
      "reason": "Matches your interests in Technology and Mathematics. JEE Main is an excellent fit for competitive programming careers."
    }
  ],
  "total_results": 15,
  "filtered_out": 27
}
```

**Ranking Algorithm:**
- **Deduplication**: Removes duplicate careers in results
- **Score Filtering**: Only includes paths with score > 0
- **Limiting**: Returns top 15 results
- **Contextual Reasons**: Provides personalized explanation for each ranking

## Business Logic

### Transition Rules
The system enforces subject combination rules defined in `rules/transition_rules.json`. For example:
- BiPC (Biology, Physics, Chemistry) → Can pursue Medical careers, Agriculture, or Science
- BiPC → Cannot pursue Engineering (blocked by rules)
- HEC (Hindi, English, Commerce) → Can pursue CA, CS, Commerce careers

### Career Roadmaps
Each career includes a 4-phase roadmap:
```
1. Short Term (1-2 years): Foundation building
2. Mid Term (2-4 years): Skill specialization
3. Career Entry (4-6 years): First professional role
4. Growth (6+ years): Career advancement and leadership
```

### AI Ranking Factors
- **Interest Alignment**: How well the path matches stated interests (40%)
- **Skill Match**: Alignment with user's strengths (30%)
- **Academic Feasibility**: Required scores vs. user's academic level (20%)
- **Career Viability**: Job market demand and salary potential (10%)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```bash
# API Server
API_HOST=127.0.0.1
API_PORT=8000
API_RELOAD=true

# Data
DATA_PATH=../career-data

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### CORS Configuration
Current CORS settings allow:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default)
- Production: Update in `main.py` line with `allow_origins`

## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
# from backend/
pytest test_api.py -v
```

### Test Coverage
- Stream retrieval endpoints
- Variant resolution
- Path computation
- Career explanation
- Ranking algorithm with various interest combinations
- Error handling (404, invalid parameters)

### Manual Testing
Use the Swagger UI at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to test all endpoints interactively.

```bash
# Get streams for Class 10
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/streams?class=10

# Get variants for Science stream
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/variants?stream=science

# Get paths for MPC variant

## Performance Considerations

- **Data Loading**: ~500ms on startup (one-time)
- **Stream Query**: <10ms (indexed lookup)
- **Path Computation**: <50ms (graph traversal)
- **Ranking**: <100ms per 50 paths (similarity scoring)
- **Memory Usage**: ~150MB with full dataset

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Port 8000 already in use | Change port: `--port 8001` |
| ModuleNotFoundError: fastapi | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| 404 on /docs | Ensure server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000 |
| CORS errors from frontend | Check CORS origins in `main.py` |
| Career not found | Verify career ID doesn't include namespace prefix |
| Ranking returns no results | Ensure valid_paths format matches schema |
