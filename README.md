## 💻 Development Guide

### Adding a New Action

1. **Add to ACTION_METADATA** in `frontend/src/pages/ActionDetail.jsx`:
```jsx
const ACTION_METADATA = {
  'new_action_id': {
    title: 'New Action Title',
    icon: '🎯',
    category: 'universal',
    color: '#FF6B35',
    fullDescription: 'Description...',
    keyPoints: ['Point 1', 'Point 2', ...],
    resources: [...],
    timeline: 'Timeline',
    difficulty: 'Medium',
    importance: 'High'
  }
}
```

2. **Update backend** (optional) in `backend/nba_actions_matrix.json`

3. **Test** by navigating to `/action/new_action_id`

### Customizing Roadmap Phases

Edit `CareerRoadmap.jsx` to adjust:
- Phase titles and icons
- Duration estimates
- Conditional phase inclusion based on `nbaAttributes`
- Milestone descriptions

### Styling Components

Use CSS variables defined in `frontend/src/index.css`:
```css
color: var(--primary)          /* Cyan */
color: var(--text-secondary)   /* Gray */
background: var(--bg-darker)   /* Dark navy */
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Port 8000 already in use | Kill process: `lsof -i :8000` or `netstat -ano \| findstr :8000` |
| Frontend won't load | Check `npm run dev` in frontend folder |
| API calls failing | Verify backend is running on port 8000 |
| ActionDetail blank | Check if actionId is in ACTION_METADATA |
| Roadmap not showing | Verify nbaAttributes passed from CareerDetail |
| Animations laggy | Check browser DevTools performance |
