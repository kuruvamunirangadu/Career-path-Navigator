Create a clean JSON structure for Class 10 career data in India.
Include:
- Streams (Science, Commerce)
- Stream variants (MPC, BiPC, MEC)
- Courses (Engineering, Medical, Degree)
- Careers mapped to courses
Keep it simple and scalable.

// Example deliverables:
// - career-data/class_10.json
// - career-data/streams.json
// - career-data/stream_variants.json
// - career-data/courses.json
// - career-data/careers.json

// Notes:
// - Use stable IDs like "stream:science", "variant:mpc", "course:engineering_btech"
// - Keep facts (eligibility, subjects, exams) separate from opinion (AI ranking)
// - This is for an MVP covering Science + Commerce only
